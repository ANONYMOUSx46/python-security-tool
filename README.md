# Security Tool

This is a custom security tool implemented in Python that combines machine learning for anomaly detection and automated vulnerability scanning and threat detection.

## Features

- Port scanning using Nmap
- Anomaly detection using a simple neural network model
- Automated vulnerability scanning using Nessus, Nexpose, or OpenVAS
- Automated threat detection using Snort, Suricata, or Bro

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Nmap library
- TensorFlow library
- A target ip-address

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.x and ensure it's added to the PATH.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

    `pip install nmap tensorflow`

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the script using the command:

    `python security_tool.py`

4. The script will perform port scanning, anomaly detection, vulnerability scanning, and threat detection based on the specified target.

## Configuration

You can configure the target IP address or range for scanning by modifying the `target` variable in the `main()` function of the script.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue or submit a pull request for any enhancements or bug fixes.

## note:
The script is simplified and may require additional error handling and refinement based on specific requirements.
